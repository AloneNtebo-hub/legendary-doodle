# Nodemailer for sending emails via Gmail
# 1. Install nodemailer in your backend directory:
npm install nodemailer

# 2. Enable "Less secure app access" or use an App Password for your Gmail account (recommended for security).
#    Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
#    Generate an app password for "Mail" and "Other" (give it a name like "PortfolioContact").
#    Use this app password instead of your Gmail password in the code.

# 3. Add the following code to your server.js to send emails.
#    (I'll update your server.js after installing nodemailer.)
